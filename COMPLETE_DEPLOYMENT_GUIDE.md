# Complete Deployment Guide: Spring Boot to GitHub

This comprehensive guide will walk you through building, testing, and deploying your Spring Boot webhook solver application to GitHub with automated CI/CD.

## üéØ **What You'll Accomplish**

1. **Install Java and build tools**
2. **Build and test the application**
3. **Deploy to GitHub with automated workflows**
4. **Create public releases with JAR files**
5. **Set up continuous integration and deployment**

## üìã **Prerequisites**

- Windows 10/11
- Administrator privileges (for some installations)
- GitHub account
- Internet connection

## üöÄ **Phase 1: Environment Setup**

### **Step 1: Install Java 17**

**Option A: Automatic Installation (Recommended)**
1. Right-click `run-as-admin.bat`
2. Select "Run as administrator"
3. Follow the installation prompts

**Option B: Manual Installation**
1. Go to: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17
2. Download **Windows x64 MSI Installer**
3. Run as Administrator
4. Check "Add to PATH" during installation

### **Step 2: Verify Installation**

```cmd
# Check Java version
java --version

# Check Maven wrapper
.\mvnw.cmd --version
```

**Expected Output:**
```
openjdk version "17.0.9" 2023-10-17
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-17.0.9+9 (build 17.0.9+9)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM Temurin-17.0.9+9 (build 17.0.9+9, mixed mode, sharing)
```

## üî® **Phase 2: Build and Test**

### **Step 1: Build the Application**

```cmd
# Clean and build (skipping tests for now)
.\mvnw.cmd clean package -DskipTests

# Or with tests (recommended for production)
.\mvnw.cmd clean package
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] Total time:  15.234 s
[INFO] Finished at: 2023-08-29T10:58:00+00:00
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

### **Step 2: Verify Build Artifacts**

```cmd
# Check target directory
dir target

# Verify JAR file exists
dir target\webhook-solver-*.jar
```

**Expected Files:**
```
target/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ webhook-solver-1.0.0.jar          # Executable JAR
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ webhook-solver-1.0.0.jar.original # Original JAR
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ classes/                          # Compiled classes
```

### **Step 3: Test the Application**

```cmd
# Run the application
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run

# Or run the JAR directly
java -jar target/webhook-solver-1.0.0.jar
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Application started. Initiating webhook flow...
Starting webhook flow execution...
Webhook generated successfully. URL: [webhook_url]
Question type determined: ODD for regNo: REG12347
SQL solution generated for question type: ODD
Solution saved to database with ID: 1
Solution submitted successfully via webhook
```

## üåê **Phase 3: GitHub Deployment**

### **Step 1: Create GitHub Repository**

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **"New repository"**
3. Repository name: `webhook-solver`
4. Description: `Spring Boot application that solves SQL problems and submits solutions via webhooks`
5. Make it **Public** (for public JAR downloads)
6. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

### **Step 2: Deploy Using Automated Script**

**Option A: PowerShell (Recommended)**
```powershell
# Run as Administrator if needed
.\deploy-to-github.ps1
```

**Option B: Batch File**
```cmd
# Run as Administrator if needed
deploy-to-github.bat
```

**Option C: Manual Git Commands**
```cmd
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Spring Boot Webhook Solver"

# Add remote origin (replace with your details)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/webhook-solver.git

# Create main branch and push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### **Step 3: Monitor GitHub Actions**

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Actions** tab
3. Monitor the build process
4. Download JAR files from successful builds

## üì¶ **Phase 4: Create Public Releases**

### **Step 1: Automatic Release (Recommended)**

1. **Tag your release:**
```cmd
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

2. **GitHub Actions will automatically:**
   - Build the application
   - Create a release
   - Upload JAR file as release asset

### **Step 2: Manual Release**

1. Go to **Releases** in your repository
2. Click **"Create a new release"**
3. Tag version: `v1.0.0`
4. Title: `Webhook Solver v1.0.0`
5. Description: Add release notes
6. Upload JAR file from `target/webhook-solver-1.0.0.jar`
7. Click **"Publish release"**

## üîó **Phase 5: Get Public Download Links**

### **Repository URL**
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/webhook-solver
```

### **JAR Download Links**
After creating a release:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/webhook-solver/releases/download/v1.0.0/webhook-solver-1.0.0.jar
```

### **RAW Download Links**
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/webhook-solver/main/target/webhook-solver-1.0.0.jar
```

## üìä **Phase 6: Monitor and Maintain**

### **GitHub Actions Dashboard**
- Monitor builds in **Actions** tab
- View build logs and test results
- Download build artifacts

### **Repository Insights**
- View traffic and downloads
- Monitor issues and pull requests
- Track code contributions

## üö® **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **Build Failures**
1. **Java not found**: Install Java 17 and restart terminal
2. **Maven errors**: Use Maven wrapper (`.\mvnw.cmd`)
3. **Dependency issues**: Check internet connection and Maven repositories

### **Deployment Issues**
1. **Authentication failed**: Use Personal Access Token
2. **Repository not found**: Create repository on GitHub first
3. **Push rejected**: Check remote origin and permissions

### **GitHub Actions Issues**
1. **Workflow not running**: Check `.github/workflows/` directory
2. **Build failures**: Check Actions tab for error logs
3. **JAR not uploaded**: Verify build success and artifact paths

## üéâ **Success Checklist**

- [ ] Java 17 installed and working
- [ ] Application builds successfully
- [ ] JAR file generated in target directory
- [ ] Git repository initialized
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow running
- [ ] Build successful in Actions tab
- [ ] Release created with JAR file
- [ ] Public download links working

## üì± **Next Steps After Deployment**

1. **Test the deployed application** using the generated JAR
2. **Share your repository** with others
3. **Monitor usage** and feedback
4. **Update documentation** as needed
5. **Create additional releases** for new versions
6. **Submit to Bajaj hiring form** with your GitHub repository

## üîê **Security Considerations**

- **Public repository**: Anyone can see your code
- **No sensitive data**: Ensure no API keys or passwords in code
- **Dependencies**: All dependencies are public and safe
- **JAR files**: Safe to distribute publicly
